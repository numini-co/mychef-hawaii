A Gold Coast dinner and a North Shore surcharge day are not the same drive; the quote says which. Personal-chef weeks for households sit next to visitor dinners. The crew in the photograph is the point: this is not one person with a tote bag and a hope.`,
  maui: `Maui is the villa dinner people picture when they say private chef — Wailea, West Maui, Kīhei, Kapalua, Makena, each with its own corridor page. Catering is the larger door on this island. The same team shops, cooks, and staffs the room. A reception on the lawn is a different crew than Date Night for two. We write that difference before the deposit.`,
  kauai: `Kauaʻi is both shores, inquiry-stage: Princeville and Hanalei on the north, Poʻipū and Kōloa on the south. The bridge and the weather are real; far-North inquiries inherit a written road clause instead of a shrug. We staff the estate to the guest list when a crew exists. We do not pretend Līhuʻe and Hāʻena are the same afternoon.`,
  bigisland: `Hawaiʻi Island is west-side first: Kona, Waikoloa, the Kohala Coast. Kona has its own page on this host. Hilo is a different day — we will not sell a same-day round trip. Ironman week compresses the calendar. Tell us the dates early. The crew size still follows the house.`,

                how a booking is crewed. They are not a claim that twenty-five W-2 employees live on every island.
