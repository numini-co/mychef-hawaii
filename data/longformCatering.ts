      'Most Honolulu residences do not have a restaurant pass. Buffet on this island is the honest answer to that fact. Stations live on the island, along a dining table that only seats eight, or on a lānai rail that can take the heat. Guests walk the line. The crew keeps pans hot and the floor moving. Quiet hours still apply in a tower. This is how a twenty-to-fifty list eats in a high-rise without pretending the galley is a hotel kitchen. It starts to make sense around twenty guests. Below that, a stationed line is usually more theatre than need.',
      'Plated service on Oahu belongs to houses that already have a table and a pass. Courses leave the kitchen paced, the way a dining room expects. Kahala and Gold Coast estates can hold that arc. A Kakaʻako one-bedroom cannot. Plated needs more hands on the floor for the same headcount, which is why the staffing line grows and the food band does not. We will not sell a coursed night into a room that cannot sit it.',
      'Family-style is the long-table middle when a Kahala dining room already seats the inner circle — usually a dozen, sometimes eighteen — and nobody wants a stationed line in a house that has a real table. Shared platters. One conversation. Cocktail hour in a tower is boards on the island and passed bites down a short hall: grazing $750–$950 as a labeled market reference, pūpū $5–$7 a piece with twenty-piece minimums. A live-fire station on a Ko Olina lānai is cooking in front of the room, not a photograph we stage.',

Two people who want a fixed-price elopement dinner are a different product, not a miniature banquet.',

Merrie Monarch week is exactly when that honesty matters — the island is already full, and the saddle is not a commute.',

      'A buffet on the lava coast is ranch-scale, not cafeteria. Stations have to survive a Kohala breeze and a heat that dries protein if you turn your back. Pans are chosen for the wind. The line is set where the wall cuts the gust. This is how a Waikoloa great room feeds thirty without asking a residential range to fire seventy plated mains at once. Reunion weeks and informal receptions live here.',
      'Plated on this island is a terrace count. Twelve seats at Mauna Lani, a kitchen that is actually a kitchen, courses leaving a pass into still air behind a lanai screen. It is the format when the list is already a table and the house can pace. It is not the format we haul over the saddle to Hilo in one day. More servers, same food band. The $150–$225 start does not jump because the plate has a rim.',
      'Family-style is the teak table down a Kohala lawn — an inner-circle count, platters in the middle, the evening still light. The hour people are still coming up from Kona is a board on the lava-rock wall and passed bites in the heat: grazing in the $750–$950 labeled market band, pieces $5–$7 once we clear a twenty-piece floor. Live fire belongs to estates that can take smoke and a grill; coffee-country evenings in Hōlualoa are cooler and often want the covered version of the same food.',
