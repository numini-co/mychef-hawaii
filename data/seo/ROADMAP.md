# SEO rebuild roadmap

The blueprint zip (`mychef-hawaii-seo-blueprint.zip`) was not on this machine. Wave 1 ships the unique-corridor + unique-hero slice using DataForSEO volumes already in `data/offers.ts` (US, location code 2840, pulled 4 Sep 2026). Attach the zip to continue the remaining work verbatim.

## Wave 1 — shipped in this branch (~25%)

- Live corridor URLs on every island host (`/{slug}`), unique title / H1 / lede / FAQ / hero.
- Middleware no longer 301s those slugs to `/`. `/locations/:slug` 301s to `/:slug`.
- Island catering, wedding, and bar heroes are island-specific Grok stills.
- Eight new corridor stills (Honolulu, Kahala, Lahaina, Kīhei, Hanalei, Kapaʻa, Waimea, Waikoloa).
- XML sitemaps list master money URLs **and** corridor URLs.
- `npm run seo:audit` plus GitHub Action — uniqueness is automatic on every push.
- DataForSEO client remains `npm run seo:ping|volumes|related|snapshot` (credentials in gitignored `.env.local`).

## Wave 2 — shipped in this branch

- `/events` is its own occasion document on every island (not a catering alias). Titles do not use the catering money keywords.
- `/mobile-bar` is the 4-hour package; `/bar` is the bartender add-on. Unique stills and titles.
- Island `/about` pages with unique crew copy and stills. Hub `/about` still names the four-island company.
- Unique private-chef and vacation-chef Grok stills on every island.
- Island sitemaps now include `/about` and `/events`.
- Canonical aliases for `/events` and `/mobile-bar` removed so they self-canonicalize.

## Wave 3 — supporting documents (this branch)

The blueprint zip is still not on this machine. Wave 3 ships the catalog cells that do not cannibalize money keywords:

- Unique `/faq`, `/coverage`, `/how-it-works`, and `/menus` on every island host.
- Unique island cells: Oʻahu kamaʻāina / conventions / gold-coast / short-stay; Maui south-maui / west-maui / wedding-week; Kauaʻi hanalei-bridge / north-shore / south-shore / wedding-week; Hawaiʻi Island kohala-corridor / coffee-act-198 / ironman-weeks / east-side.
- Maui `/lahaina` stays the neighborhood URL (catalog UNIQUE `/lahaina` is not a second page).
- Hub `/corporate` and `/gatherings` no longer share a title.
- New Grok stills for every Wave 3 URL.

## Wave 4 — honesty, dinner SKUs, occasion cells (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 4 ships the catalog service and occasion cells that do not cannibalize money keywords:

- Unique `/what-we-dont-do`, `/guest-counts`, `/dietary`, `/honeymoon-dinners`, `/chefs-table`, `/kids-menus` on every island host.
- Unique `/events/birthdays`, `/events/welcome-dinners`, `/events/retreats` on every island host, linked from `/events`.

- Unique `/rehearsal-dinners`, `/meal-prep`, `/cooking-classes`, `/omakase-at-home`, `/corporate-catering`, `/retreat-catering` on every island host. Meal prep and classes stay honesty/gated pages.
- Unique `/catering/bbq|plated|family-style|buffet|grazing|drop-off` on every island host. Titles are format documents (“Plated villa service on Oahu”), never “Oahu catering plated”. Drop-off is explicitly not staffed service.
- New Grok stills for every Wave 5 URL.

## Wave 6 — fine dining, staffing, menu SKUs, resident line (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 6 ships the next catalog slice that does not cannibalize money keywords:

- Unique `/fine-dining/romantic-dinner|tasting-menu|chefs-table-evening|celebration-dinner` on every island host. Halo formats, not Michelin claims. Distinct from `/honeymoon-dinners`, `/omakase-at-home`, `/chefs-table`, and occasion pages.
- Unique `/staffing/servers|bartenders|butlers` on every island host. Quoted hourly add-ons. Distinct from `/bar` and `/mobile-bar`. Butlers stay honesty/quoted.
- Unique `/menus/three-course|family-style-menu|breakfast|lunch` on every island host. Designed per table, not a fake standing carte. Distinct from `/menus` as a process page.
- Unique `/personal-chef` on every island host as the resident household line. Does not steal `/private-chef` titles or “private chef {island}” money keywords. Oʻahu sits beside `/kamaaina`.
- New Grok stills for every Wave 6 URL.

## Wave 7 — help articles and fee stack (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 7 ships the remaining catalog stand-in that does not cannibalize money keywords:

- Unique `/thank-you` on every island host — noindex, unique H1, lede, next links, Grok still. Hub keeps the statewide mahalo page.

## Wave 12 — unique dining-in blog notes (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 12 ships live `/blog/dining-in-{corridor}` notes for every money neighborhood (20 URLs):

- Remaining extra-blog seeds stay unpublished: they overlap live occasion, menu, staffing, and bar URLs.
- Titles never use money keywords. Kauaʻi and Hawaiʻi Island stay inquiry. New Grok stills for every Wave 24 URL.

## Wave 27 — unique hub directories for island-only support paths (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 27 ships hub pickers for paths that already 200 on island hosts but 404'd on the apex:

- Unique hub `/faq`, `/coverage`, `/contact`, `/locations`, `/menus`, `/help`, `/fine-dining`, `/staffing`.
- Distinct from the matching island-host documents, from hub `/areas` (map notes), and from hub `/journal` / `/blog` pickers.

- Schema, FAQ, and sample-menu expansions the zip specifies beyond the catalog stand-in.
- Hub vs island keyword split exactly as the zip writes it.

## Wave 32 — automation that stays on

- `seo:audit` in CI (this branch).
- Scheduled `seo:snapshot` Action shipped in Wave 8 — add `DATAFORSEO_LOGIN` / `DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD` GitHub secrets to turn it on. Do not commit secrets.
- Search Console / indexation pass after Wave 1 is on `main`: inspect one corridor URL per island, then the rest.
- Keep `*.mychef-hawaii.com` attached on the Vercel project so island hosts never 404.

## Wave 33 — supporting-area unique cells (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 33 ships unique `/{slug}` dinner doors for supporting areas that already had `/blog/dining-in-{slug}` kitchen notes but 404'd at the place URL (32 cells). These are unique cells, **not** money corridors — null-volume place names stay out of money titles, and they are not added to middleware `CORRIDORS`.

- Oʻahu: `/lanikai`, `/hawaii-kai`, `/diamond-head`, `/kakaako`, `/downtown`, `/kaneohe`, `/ewa`.
- Maui: `/upcountry`, `/napili`, `/paia`, `/makawao`, `/honokowai`, `/waikapu`, `/haleakala`.

- New Grok stills for every Wave 33 URL. Kauaʻi and Hawaiʻi Island stay inquiry. Hilo / Volcano / Kaʻū stay quote-only dedicated days.

## Wave 34 — extra-blog kitchen notes beside live SKUs (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 34 ships the remaining extra-blog seeds as unique kitchen notes beside live SKUs (11 slugs × 4 islands = 44 articles, plus 11 hub pickers). They do not steal occasion, menu, staffing, or bar titles.

## Wave 35 — remaining journal kitchen notes beside live SKUs (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 35 ships the remaining journal seeds as unique kitchen notes beside live SKUs (3 slugs × 4 islands = 12 articles, plus 3 hub pickers). They do not steal wedding, vacation-chef, or coverage titles.

- `/journal/wedding-week` beside `/weddings` (and Maui/Kauaʻi `/wedding-week` cells)
- `/journal/vacation-chef-week` beside `/vacation-chef`
- `/journal/travel-zones` beside `/coverage`
- Hub pickers for each slug. Dining-in blogs stay island-only.
- Island switcher treats `/journal/wedding-week` as a four-island nested key so it does not collide with Maui/Kauaʻi `/wedding-week` cells.
- Titles never use money keywords. Kauaʻi and Hawaiʻi Island stay inquiry. New Grok stills for every Wave 35 URL.

## Wave 36 — quieter unique-document chrome (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 36 tightens the unique-page template used by cells, journals, blogs, SKUs, and corridor documents:

- Unique documents no longer repeat the cell name as a second H2, then a related strip, then a generic money-nav cluster.
- Body copy and related island links sit in one paper column after the hero. FAQ and the quote closer stay.
- Money corridor pages keep a unique “how a booking runs” heading and the island money links.

## Wave 37 — leftover luxury chrome on hub money pages (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 37 finishes type-on-photography on hub money-adjacent pages that still used paper cards or TypePanel on the still:

- Hub `/private-chef` and `/vacation-chef` use cinematic heroes plus a 4-up island photo picker.
- Hub `/catering` island picker is the same photo 4-up, not paper tiles.
- Hub `/weddings` island strips and hub `/islands` full-bleed rows put type on the photograph with scrims. Quote-form TypePanel stays — that is a WCAG paper field, not homepage chrome.
- Island `/vacation-chef` adds a body column and related links so the SKU is not only a hero plus generic money nav.

## Wave 38 — leftover bar chrome (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 38 finishes type-on-photography leftovers on the bar money pages:

- Hub `/bar` and `/mobile-bar` island pickers are photo 4-ups with published starting prices, not paper tariff rows.
- Island `/bar` and `/mobile-bar` add a body column and related links so the SKU is not only a hero plus FAQ.
- Hub `/about` hero quote button matches the paper-on-photo treatment.

## Wave 39 — hub rate card chrome + paper quote buttons on remaining heroes (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 39 finishes leftover type-on-photography on the rate card and remaining unique-document heroes:

- Hub `/pricing` uses a cinematic hero plus a 4-up island picker. The published tariff table stays so islands can still be compared on one page.
- Island money and unique-document heroes that still used an ink quote button on the photograph now use the paper button (`variant="light"`). Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 40 — photo pickers on unique hub directories (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 40 replaces paper island tiles on unique hub pickers with the same 4-up photography used on money pages:

- All 89 hub directory URLs (support, nested SKUs, journal/blog pickers) open island documents from selector stills.
- Hub `/areas`, `/journal`, `/blog`, `/services`, `/corporate`, and `/gatherings` use the same picker.
- Homepage island chooser shares that component. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 41 — cinematic heroes on remaining paper hub indexes (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 41 puts type on photography on the leftover statewide indexes that still opened as paper H1s:

- Hub `/how-it-works`, `/trust`, `/legal`, `/areas`, `/journal`, `/blog`, `/services`, `/islands`, and `/quote` use cinematic heroes and unique Grok stills (unused plates, papers, brass; no readable text).
- Hub `/how-it-works`, `/trust`, and `/legal` also open the matching island document from the 4-up picker.
- Hub `/islands` keeps full-bleed home rows and opens each island `/islands` list from photography, not paper tiles.
- Island `/islands` other-host lists use the same full-bleed selector stills. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 42 — island directory lists on existing photography (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 42 lifts island-host directory lists off paper tiles onto the stills those documents already use:

- `/locations`, `/areas`, `/services`, `/help`, `/fine-dining`, `/staffing`, `/corporate`, `/gatherings`.
- Island `/journal` and `/blog` indexes open live pieces from photography.
- `stillForPath` is the shared lookup OG images already used. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 43 — leftover paper doors onto photography (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 43 lifts the remaining paper lists and inset stills onto the same photography language:

- Hub `/services` four statewide doors are a 4-up photo grid (private chef, catering, weddings, bar).
- Island `/events` occasion lists use `DocumentPhotoGrid`.
- Island catering format lists use `DocumentPhotoGrid`. Hub `/catering` opens the six format pickers (`/catering/bbq|plated|family-style|buffet|grazing|drop-off`) from photography.
- Hub and island `/thank-you` use a cinematic short hero. Optional follow-up form stays on paper. New hub still `hub-thanks.png`.

## Wave 44 — nested hub pickers onto photography (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 44 lists nested hub pickers from photography on parent indexes that already owned those URLs:

- Hub `/events`, `/fine-dining`, `/staffing`, `/menus`, and `/help` open their nested pickers from stills, then the island document.

- Quote-form TypePanel stays. Coverage/zones and the HTML sitemap stay paper.

## Wave 45 — mobile-bar keyword + leftover wedding stills (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 45 puts the measured `mobile bar hawaii` (20) title on hub `/mobile-bar` and stops hub `/bar` from stealing it:

- Hub `/mobile-bar` title is `Mobile bar Hawaii | 4-hour villa package`. Hub `/bar` is the bartender add-on.

## Wave 48 — island /bar H1s stay off the mobile-bar keyword (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 48 finishes the `/bar` vs `/mobile-bar` split on island hosts:

- Maui `/bar` H1 is the bartender add-on, not “Mobile bar…”. The four-hour package stays on `/mobile-bar`.

- Hub `/islands` is the host picker. It no longer titles as “Private chef Oahu, Maui, Kauai & Big Island”.
- Hub `/services` no longer titles on `mobile bar hawaii`. That phrase stays on hub `/mobile-bar`.
- Island `/personal-chef` takes the measured household phrases (`personal chef honolulu`, `personal chef maui`). Island `/private-chef` is the visitor-dinner document and no longer uses those titles.

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 58 stops catalog and location fallback titles from being able to ship money keywords, and gives hub `/how-it-works` the same related-document photography as island `/how-it-works`:

- Catalog `entry()` titles are `${label} on ${island} | myCHEF`. They never use `Private chef & catering`. Kauaʻi `/north-shore` catalog lede no longer stuffs `Private chef Kauai`.
- Location and area SEO fallbacks are kitchen/map notes, not `private chef {place}`. Middleware still 301s those URLs; the strings cannot ship if a rewrite ever misses.

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 90 uniquifies remaining catalog FAQ clones in catering formats, fine-dining courses, gated services, help articles, cooking-class notes, menu SKUs, and extra occasions. Titles, H1s, and photos were already unique. No new URLs.

- Answers now name Kahala, Wailea, Princeville, or Waikoloa. Inquiry hosts keep the inquiry clause. Hawaiʻi Island answers add “Hilo is never implied.”
- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays. No related-door photography. No new URLs.

## Wave 91 — leftover-JPEG and DataForSEO title gates (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 91 does not remap leftover JPEGs onto unique-cell, neighborhood, or island-home heroes. Those keys stay in `data/photos.ts` / unused `data/assets.ts`. `seo:audit` now fails if any live document hero file is one of those JPEGs, and it fails if a DataForSEO master-keyword title drops off its owner URL.

- Island-home heroes are checked by file, not only by photo key.
- Hub `/`, `/catering`, `/weddings`, `/mobile-bar`; island homes; island `/catering`; `/honolulu`, `/lahaina`, `/kona`, `/poipu`, `/north-shore`; Oahu/Maui `/personal-chef`; island `/weddings` must keep their measured title phrases.
- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays. No related-door photography. No new URLs.

## Wave 92 — leftover copy stops denying live corridor URLs (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 92 fixes hub and Hawaiʻi Island home copy that still claimed Honolulu and Kona were not their own paths. Those corridors are live URLs on the island hosts. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Hub `/` names `/wailea`, `/waikiki`, `/princeville`, and `/kona` as island-host corridors, not hub paths.
- Hawaiʻi Island `/` names `/kona`, `/waikoloa`, `/kohala`, and `/waimea`. The “separate Kona site?” FAQ points at `/kona`.
- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 93 — catalog stops listing cloned /events/weddings (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 93 removes `weddings` from the catalog EVENT_SLUGS so island catalogs no longer claim a cloned `/events/weddings` cell. `/weddings` owns wedding-catering titles. Those four URLs stay 404. `seo:audit` fails if the catalog lists `/events/weddings` again. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 94 — catalog slug lists stay locked to live unique documents (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 94 makes `seo:audit` fail if catalog EVENT / CATERING / FINE / HELP / STAFF / MENU slug lists drift from the live unique documents. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 95 — live titles never fall back to cloned catalog cells (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 95 removes the `getCatalog` title fallback from `resolveDocumentSeo`. Unique intercepts already cover every catalog cell. Cloned `${label} on ${n} | myCHEF` titles can no longer ship. `seo:audit` fails if that fallback returns. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 96 — hub visitor-dinner and Stay Chef stills stop stealing Maui (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 96 gives hub `/private-chef` and `/vacation-chef` their own Grok stills. Those hub documents no longer reuse Maui `chefMaui` / `vacationMaui`. Maui `/private-chef` and `/vacation-chef` keep the Wailea stills. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No new related-door grids — existing hub doors into those URLs now use the destination stills.

- Hub home private-chef card, hub `/services`, `/bar`, `/mobile-bar`, `/personal-chef` related doors, and OG images follow the new hub stills.
- `seo:audit` fails if hub OG or hub heroes fall back to Maui island stills.
- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 97 — hub home private-chef card stops selling Stay Chef (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 97 fixes hub home card 01 so the door into `/private-chef` describes a visitor dinner at the per-guest band. Stay Chef day rates stay on `/vacation-chef` and on the published-prices block. Hub home title still owns `private chef hawaii`. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Card line is one dinner in the villa. Card price is from $125 / $150 a guest, not $850 a day.
- `seo:audit` fails if the card sells “daily chef service” or Stay Chef day rates.
- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 98 — hub home catering card stops selling one-table dinners (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 98 fixes hub home card 02 so the door into `/catering` describes staffed villa events of about 10–75. One-table dinners stay on `/private-chef`. Hub `/catering` still owns `hawaii catering`. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Card line is buffet or plated, 10–75. Card price drops “Signature dinner.”
- `seo:audit` fails if the card sells “one dinner or a staffed event” or prints Signature dinner on that door.
- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 99 — Maui island chooser stops selling Stay Chef as stays (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 99 fixes the Maui island-chooser line so it names private dinners, not stays. Stay Chef day rates stay on the chooser price line and on `/vacation-chef`. Maui home still owns `private chef maui`. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- `seo:audit` fails if chrome copy sells “private chef stays.”
- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 100 — live titles never fall back to cloned editorial seeds (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 100 removes the `getArticle` title fallback from `resolveDocumentSeo`. Unique journal and blog intercepts already cover every live article URL. Cloned seeds such as “How much does a private chef cost on {island}?” can no longer ship if a slug is added without unique data. Hub `/journal` and `/blog` island pickers now count `journalArticles` / `blogArticles`, not `articlesFor`. `seo:audit` fails if that fallback or seed count returns. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 101 — island hosts never inherit hub pageMeta titles (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 101 stops `lookupPageMeta` from falling back to hub `PAGE_META` keys on island hosts, and stops `resolveDocumentSeo` from using the hub home DEFAULT (`Private Chef Hawaii`) when unique island data misses. Prefixed island titles (`/oahu/private-chef`, and the rest) still win. A miss now titles `{island} | myCHEF`, never the hub money title. `seo:audit` fails if that hub fallback returns. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 102 — leftover butler, drop-off, and named-farm FAQs (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 102 uniquifies the last three FAQ answers that still cloned across live unique documents: Maui/Kauaʻi/Hawaiʻi Island butler add-ons, drop-off format pages, and Oahu/Maui/Kauaʻi named-farm notes. Questions were already unique. `seo:audit` fails if those clone answers return. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 103 — leftover two-island FAQ clones (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 103 uniquifies the remaining FAQ answers that still cloned across two live unique documents (family-style vs grazing, BBQ luau refusals, dining-in and load-in notes, coffee-lot honesty). Statewide inquiry lines (“We crew when we can staff”) stay identical on purpose. `seo:audit` fails if those clone answers return. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 104 — leftover contact and resident-line FAQs (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 104 uniquifies Record-style FAQ answers that still cloned across two island documents: Oahu/Maui contact desks (no invented office or 808 number) and Maui/Hawaiʻi Island resident lines (visitors open Stay Chef). Statewide inquiry honesty stays. `seo:audit` fails if those clone answers return. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 105 — leftover hub vs Oahu catering sample-menu FAQ (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 105 uniquifies the sample-menu FAQ that still cloned between hub `/catering` and Oahu `/catering`. The island answer names a Kahala or Ko Olina house. The hub answer sends readers to the island hosts. Statewide inquiry honesty stays. `seo:audit` fails if that clone answer returns. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 106 — live catering and Kauai wedding titles own measured phrases (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 106 intercepts `cateringOffers` in `resolveDocumentSeo` so island `/catering` titles no longer drift to leftover pageMeta (Hawaiʻi Island now ships `big island catering`). Kauaʻi `/weddings` title owns the contiguous phrase `kauai wedding catering` instead of the reversed `Wedding catering Kauai`. `seo:audit` fails if those owner titles or the catering intercept return. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 107 — MASTER_KEYWORDS must match the title source that ships (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 107 makes `seo:audit` read each measured keyword’s owner title from the same source `resolveDocumentSeo` uses (pageMeta on the hub, `islandOffers` / `cateringOffers` / `residentLine` / neighborhood cells / prefixed pageMeta on island hosts). A leftover pageMeta title can no longer look green while the live document dropped the phrase. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 108 — corridor price cards stay off money keywords (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 108 keeps the published-price block on money corridors, but the four cards no longer label themselves Private chef dinner / Mobile bar. They read Villa dinner, Stay Chef, Wedding week, and Packaged cart, so `/` and hub `/mobile-bar` keep those phrases. `seo:audit` fails if those labels return. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 109 — supporting-area dinner doors publish the same rate card (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 109 extracts the corridor published-price block into `PlacePriceBlock` and shows it on `AREA_CELLS` dinner doors. Honesty unique cells (kamaʻāina, what-we-dont-do, wedding-week, coffee-act, and the rest), blogs, journals, and SKUs stay without dinner rate cards. Labels stay Villa dinner / Stay Chef / Wedding week / Packaged cart. `seo:audit` fails if those labels return or if UniqueCellView shows the block without the AREA_CELLS gate. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays. Corridor and supporting-area `PlacePriceBlock` is a paper rate-card strip.

## Wave 110 — island homes publish the same rate card (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 110 shows `PlacePriceBlock` on every island `/`, the live owner of `private chef {island}`. The four cards stay Villa dinner / Stay Chef / Wedding week / Packaged cart. H2 is `What a night in {island} starts at`, distinct from corridor and supporting-area H2s and from `/pricing`. Honesty unique cells stay without dinner rate cards. `seo:audit` fails if island homes drop the block. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays. `PlacePriceBlock` is a paper rate-card strip.

## Wave 111 — JSON-LD offer names stay off money keywords (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 111 renames the OfferCatalog JSON-LD names that still said Private chef dinner / Wedding catering / Mobile bar — the same leak Wave 108 removed from visible cards. Offers now read Villa dinner, Stay Chef, Wedding week, and Packaged cart. The catalog title is “published prices”, not “private chef and catering prices”. `seo:audit` fails if those JSON-LD names return. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 112 — leftover related-door and rate-card labels stay off money keywords (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 112 renames leftover visible labels that still said Private chef dinner, 4-hour mobile bar, or Mobile bar package after the corridor cards were renamed. Island `/services` cards read What’s included and The packaged cart. Wedding related doors and the `/pricing` cart row match. Owner-page H1s and titles on `/mobile-bar` stay. `seo:audit` fails if those labels return. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 113 — OfferCatalog JSON-LD stays on rate and product pages (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 113 stops spraying the four-offer catalog onto `/events`, `/menus`, `/bar`, hub `/corporate`, and hub `/gatherings`. Catalog stays on `/`, `/pricing`, `/private-chef-cost`, `/services`, and the dinner / Stay Chef / catering / wedding / packaged-cart product URLs. `seo:audit` fails if those spray paths return. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 114 — LocalBusiness JSON-LD stays on identity pages (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 114 stops stamping `LocalBusiness` with `serviceType: Private chef` onto every unique URL. Organization and WebPage JSON-LD stay on every document. LocalBusiness stays on `/`, `/about`, and `/contact` — the identity pages — so island homes keep `private chef {island}` and blogs, menus, and honesty cells do not. `seo:audit` fails if the unconditional stamp returns. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 115 — leftover catering and hub service labels stay off money keywords (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 115 renames leftover visible labels that still said Wedding catering / Wedding catering Hawaii on `/catering` rate cards, and Private chef on the hub `/services` door into `/private-chef`. Cards now read Wedding week and What’s included, matching PlacePriceBlock and island `/services`. Owner-page H1s and titles on `/weddings` and hub `/` stay. `seo:audit` fails if those labels return. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 116 — /wedding-catering 301s onto /weddings (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 116 stops shipping `/wedding-catering` as a live alias with a competing wedding-catering title. Middleware 301s `/wedding-catering` (and `/[island]/wedding-catering`) onto `/weddings`. The island page, pageMeta titles, and OfferCatalog path are gone. `seo:audit` fails if the alias page, titles, or missing 301 return. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 117 — support titles stay off the rest of MASTER_KEYWORDS (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 117 expands the unique-audit money-title gate to the remaining measured phrases: `kauai wedding catering`, `mobile bar hawaii`, `personal chef honolulu|maui|oahu`, and the long-tail private-chef corridors. Support and hub-directory titles already stay off those phrases; the gate fails if one returns. Island `/personal-chef` owner titles stay out of this walk. Owner titles on `/`, `/catering`, `/weddings`, `/mobile-bar`, and money corridors are not in this walk. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 118 — island-home dinner doors stay off money keywords (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 118 renames the island-home card into `/private-chef` from Private chef to What’s included, matching island `/services` and hub `/services`. Island `/` H1s still own `private chef {island}`. Hub home keeps its product heading. `seo:audit` fails if that island-home label returns. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 119 — unique documents keep unique stills across types (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 119 makes `seo:audit` fail if two live unique documents share a hero file across types (corridor vs cell vs SKU vs hub directory vs journal vs blog). Within-type uniqueness already existed. Named catalog cells already have unique live copy; this gate keeps the Grok stills from collapsing while the zip is missing. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 120 — site header and hub /services stay off the private-chef keyword (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 120 points the site-header Private chef item at `/` — the live owner of `private chef {island}` and `private chef hawaii` — instead of `/private-chef`, the inclusion document. Hub `/services` hero copy now reads Villa dinners / wedding weeks, matching PlacePriceBlock. Hub home still merchandises its own Private chef card into `/private-chef`. `seo:audit` fails if the header path or hub `/services` lede return. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays. Site header/footer stay paper.

## Wave 121 — OfferCatalog serviceType stays off money keywords (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 121 stops OfferCatalog JSON-LD from classifying Villa dinner / Stay Chef / Wedding week as Private chef, Personal chef, or Catering. Those serviceTypes leaked the money phrases onto `/pricing`, `/services`, and `/private-chef`. Offers now use Villa dinner / Stay Chef / Wedding week / Bartending. LocalBusiness on `/`, `/about`, and `/contact` still uses `serviceType: Private chef`. Owner-page FoodService JSON-LD on hub `/catering` and `/weddings` stays. `seo:audit` fails if those catalog serviceTypes return. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 122 — island chooser lines stay off catering money keywords (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 122 rewrites the shared island-chooser lines so they no longer say Oʻahu catering / Maui catering / Kauaʻi catering. Those phrases were reused on hub home (links to `/`), hub `/private-chef`, and hub `/pricing` — none of which own the island catering titles. Cards now read villa dinners and staffed events. Island `/catering` H1s and titles stay. `seo:audit` fails if those chooser phrases return. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 123 — island catering sample menus stay off hawaii catering (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 123 stops island `/catering` sample-menu kickers from saying Hawaii catering menu — that phrase belongs on hub `/catering`. Island kickers now read Oahu catering menu / Maui catering menu / Kauai catering menu / Big Island catering menu, matching each host’s owner title. Hub `/catering` keeps Hawaii catering menu. `seo:audit` fails if the shared kicker returns. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 124 — island catering and wedding owners ship FoodService JSON-LD (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 124 gives island `/catering` and `/weddings` the same owner FoodService JSON-LD the hub already ships. Names use each host’s live H1 keyword (Oahu catering, Maui catering, Kauai wedding catering, and the rest). Hub `/catering` and `/weddings` stay. `seo:audit` fails if those island FoodService nodes drop. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 125 — hub /mobile-bar ships owner FoodService JSON-LD (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 125 gives hub `/mobile-bar` the same owner FoodService JSON-LD catering and weddings already ship, named Mobile bar Hawaii. Island `/mobile-bar` gets island-specific FoodService names from their H1s and `serviceType: Bartending`, so the statewide phrase stays on the hub. `seo:audit` fails if the hub node drops. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 126 — corridor and personal-chef owners ship FoodService JSON-LD (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 126 gives money corridors and `/personal-chef` the same owner FoodService JSON-LD catering, weddings, and `/mobile-bar` already ship. Corridor names come from each dinner-door title (`Private chef Honolulu`, `Private chef Kona`, and the rest) with `serviceType: Villa dinner`. Oahu and Maui `/personal-chef` use `Personal chef`; Kauaʻi and Hawaiʻi Island use Household cooking. Blogs, journals, and SKUs stay FAQ-only. `seo:audit` fails if those nodes drop. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 127 — hub and island homes ship owner FoodService JSON-LD (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 127 gives hub `/` and every island `/` a named FoodService node for `private chef hawaii` / `private chef {island}`, matching the owner schema already on catering, weddings, `/mobile-bar`, corridors, and `/personal-chef`. LocalBusiness on identity pages stays `myCHEF {island}`. `seo:audit` fails if those home nodes drop. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 128 — hub /bar meta stays off mobile bar hawaii (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 128 rewrites the hub `/bar` meta description so the bartender add-on no longer uses the contiguous `mobile bar Hawaii` phrase owned by hub `/mobile-bar`. Visible `/bar` copy already said packaged cart. `seo:audit` fails if that meta phrase returns. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 129 — identity LocalBusiness is no longer also FoodService (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 129 drops FoodService from the identity LocalBusiness `@type` so hub `/` and island `/` do not ship two FoodService nodes. Named owner FoodService stays on the product pages. `seo:audit` fails if the dual type returns. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 130 — hub /catering ships the same OfferCatalog as other hub owners (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 130 adds hub `/catering` to the hub rate-page allow list so the `hawaii catering` owner publishes the same OfferCatalog hub `/weddings`, hub `/mobile-bar`, and island `/catering` already ship. Offer names stay Villa dinner / Stay Chef / Wedding week / Packaged cart. `seo:audit` fails if hub `/catering` drops off that list. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 131 — wedding owners ship FAQPage JSON-LD (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 131 gives hub `/weddings` and every island `/weddings` FAQPage JSON-LD for the visible wedding FAQs, matching catering owners. FoodService names stay `Wedding catering Hawaii` / island H1s. `seo:audit` fails if those FAQ nodes drop. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 132 — hub /about stops shipping a second Organization (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 132 drops the view-level Organization on hub `/about`. Layout already ships Organization plus LocalBusiness on identity pages; the extra node used a different URL (`/about` vs the origin). FAQPage stays. `seo:audit` fails if the second Organization returns. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 133 — island /private-chef and /bar ship FAQPage JSON-LD (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 133 gives island `/private-chef` and island `/bar` FAQPage JSON-LD for the FAQs already on those pages. They are not money owners — no FoodService node. `seo:audit` fails if those FAQ nodes drop. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 134 — hub home and catering FAQPage matches the visible FAQ list (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 134 puts every visible FAQ on hub `/`, hub `/catering`, and island `/catering` into FAQPage JSON-LD. Those pages were concatenating extra longform FAQs on the page but omitting them from schema. `seo:audit` fails if those lists drift apart. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 135 — /mobile-bar enters the XML sitemap (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 135 puts hub `/mobile-bar` on `MASTER_MAP` so the `mobile bar hawaii` owner is advertised to crawlers, and lists island `/mobile-bar` beside `/events` on island sitemaps. `/bar` stays an unadvertised add-on. `seo:audit` fails if those sitemap rows drop. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 136 — hub /mobile-bar ships FAQPage; competing copy drops Mobile bar (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 136 gives hub `/mobile-bar` visible FAQs and matching FAQPage JSON-LD — it was the only measured-keyword owner without them. Competing wedding, catering, and bartender-directory copy no longer uses “Mobile bar” as a product name or sends the packaged cart to `/bar`. Quote-form TypePanel stays. `seo:audit` fails if the FAQ lists drift or those product-name strings return. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 137 — site header Bar points at /mobile-bar (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 137 sends header **Bar** to `/mobile-bar`, the `mobile bar hawaii` owner — the same ownership rule as header **Private chef** → `/`. `/bar` stays the bartender add-on. The label stays **Bar**, not the money phrase. Hub `/services` Bar door and quote-form TypePanel stay. `seo:audit` fails if the header still points Bar at `/bar`. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 138 — island /personal-chef enters the support sitemap (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 138 lists island `/personal-chef` beside `/mobile-bar` on island XML and HTML sitemaps so `personal chef honolulu` and `personal chef maui` owners are advertised at support priority, not buried in the generic service-cell dump. The service-cell row is filtered to avoid duplicate locs. Hub `/personal-chef` stays a directory. `seo:audit` fails if those sitemap rows drop or duplicate. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 139 — hub /services Bar door becomes Bartender add-on (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 139 relabels the hub `/services` four-up `/bar` door to **Bartender add-on**. Header **Bar** now points at `/mobile-bar`; keeping the same word on the add-on door would send people to two URLs. The packaged cart stays in the related grid. Quote-form TypePanel stays. `seo:audit` fails if that four-up is labeled Bar again. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Wave 140 — island /private-chef stops shipping OfferCatalog (this branch)

Still no zip on this machine. Wave 140 drops island `/private-chef` from `ISLAND_RATE_JSONLD`. That URL is the inclusion doc, not a tariff — same as hub `/private-chef`, which never had the catalog. FAQPage stays. `seo:audit` fails if the catalog returns. No new URLs. No JPEG remaps. No related-door photography.

- Coverage/locations honesty lists stay paper. Quote-form TypePanel stays.

## Keyword discipline (measured, not invented)

Use these as title keywords. Null-volume neighborhood phrases stay in H1/FAQ, not in the `<title>`. `private chef maui cost` (10) stays in Maui `/private-chef-cost` and `/pricing` body copy — a support title containing that phrase would match `private chef maui`.

| Keyword | Volume |
|---|---|
| oahu catering | 720 |
| maui catering | 480 |
| private chef maui | 260 |
| private chef kauai / kauai catering / hawaii catering | 210 |
